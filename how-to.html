                            it, or had a lucky break! Maybe you have a job with the potential to grow and
                            want to start building your wealth. But you don’t want to leave money in a bank;
                            you want your money to work for you! A financial steward can guide you to take

                            advisor and encounter multiple professional individuals who want to help you.
                            How do you know what questions to ask? Having a bad wealth advisor means working
                            with someone who doesn’t have your best interest in mind. This may cause you to
                            lose focus on what’s important to you and even find it more challenging to
                            fulfill your financial goals.

                                        before making any recommendations. We refer to these advisors as
                                        aligned-interest advisors. We are big believers that the value-added of a great
                                        advisor is not to “beat the market” but rather to be your household CFO.

                                        some very bad responses. The most important thing you want your advisor to have

                                        this question, run for the hills!

                                    <p>Advisors simply don’t have the time to be your household CFO and be great
                                        stock-pickers. Great advisors understand that the key to success is
                                        understanding the required returns to accomplish your goals. If those returns
                                        seem to have a reasonable margin of safety (considering historical return
                                        profiles for a well-diversified portfolio), then — and only then — can they pick
                                        the right mix of assets that strives to deliver YOUR required rate of return
                                        with the minimum portfolio risk possible.

                                        For instance, an advisor may focus on Social Security and Medicare, but you’re
                                        30 years old! You may need more help figuring out which home you can afford or
