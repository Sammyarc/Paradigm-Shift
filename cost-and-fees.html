This is the most all-encompassing and full service you can get from a financial advisor. Most busy families opt into this relationship because of that.

                                    <p><b>AUM Fees:</b> We see fees ranging from .80% to 1.5% of the assets an advisor manages. For example, if you were to hire an advisor under the AUM fee structure, and they managed $1 million dollars for you, their annual fee would be 1% of those investments, which would equate to a $10,000 annual advisor fee. This is not an out-of-pocket expense, the fees come directly from your investment account.</p>

                                    <p>The downside of a one-time financial plan is that it is a static document in time. Should your family’s situation change, most likely your plan will need updating. More often than not, families are opting into an ongoing relationship with an advisor so they can build a relationship and allow that advisor to be proactive in protecting their wealth.
